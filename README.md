# Alexander Steinmaurer  - Academic Blog

Hi, I am Alexander Steinmaurer, a researcher and lecturer at [IT:U Austria](https://it-u.at/), a newly founded, interdisciplinary university in Linz, Austria. I am also an adjunct fellow to the [Cognitive and Digital Science Lab](https://codislabgraz.org/) at Graz University of Technology. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Faculty of Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering](https://csbme.tugraz.at/) at Graz University of Technology under the supervision of [Christian Gütl](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/pl/ui/$ctx/visitenkarte.show_vcard?pPersonenId=DBBE6CF53E98F4C0&pPersonenGruppe=3). 

During the fall semester of 2023, I worked as a Research Fellow at the [PLT Group](https://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/) of Brown University. I worked on approaches and tools to rethinking data science/programming education in times of LLMs, advised by [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/) and [Kathi Fisler](https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/).

My research interests are mainly in the field of Computer Science Education. Here is a list of topics that I am interested in:

- **Engaging learning technologies** - Designing engaging and interactive learning experiences in digital (and immersive) environments. This not only includes the development of technologies but also the evaluation within an educational setting. 
- **LLM-assisted (CS) teaching** - Meaningful (!) integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational contexts, such as individualizing learning experiences.
- **Educational data analysis** - Analysis of educational data (qualitative and quantitative) retrieved from a real-life context such as courses, workshops, learning technology, or data sets.
- **Virtual Reality in Teaching** - Using mixed reality approaches to transform traditional learning contexts in immersive learning experiences. 
- **Game-based learning and gamification** - From a broad perspective, game-based learning could be seen as an engaging learning technology. But GBL/gamification is more than "playing a game and learning". A well-considered design process, implementation, and evaluation are necessary for both the tool and the teaching context.
- **Large-scale teaching** - Evaluation of students' learning experiences within a large-scale teaching and learning context.
- **Curriculum design** - Designing dedicated curricula for different educational contexts and topics such as data science, introduction to programming, or computational thinking. 

# Teaching
## Courses
During my academic career, I had the opportunity to hold a lot of different lectures and courses. I hold/held courses at Graz University of Technology, FH Campus 02, University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, and University College of Teacher Education Styria.

- **Introduction to Programming** \[WS 2020-2024\]  - This course is offered as a first-semester course (winter semester) at TU Graz and is an introduction to programming using the C programming language. Around 800 students from different study programs participate each year in this lecture and practical lab. \[[Course website](https://coding.tugraz.at/), [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codingtugraz)\]
- **Object-oriented Programming 1**  \[SS 2021-2024\] - This follow-up course on *Introduction to Programming* is a second-semester course where students learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming using C++.  \[[Course website](https://coding.tugraz.at/), [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codingtugraz)\]
- **Project Management** \[SS 2021-2024\] - This is a mandatory course in the Bachelor's program of software engineering and management at Graz University of Technology. Students learn about the fundamentals of project management when working on an actual project in teams of four.  \[[YT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQgwLycf7xY&list=PLtrp6_jkyyuI9P3YqBdLyskZjzquqqyQ4)\]
- **Introduction to Scientific Working** [2021-2024] - This course is mandatory for TU Graz students who want to write their Bachelor's thesis. It is held each semester.  \[[Course website](https://xstone93.github.io/sci-work), [YT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIbp18fU5Ww&list=PLtrp6_jkyyuK49OmNlSEkQxmyov4K1HGc)\]
- **Engaging Learning Technologies** \[WS 2020-2024\] - In this interdisciplinary elective course, students learn about developing learning technologies and educational scenarios while evaluating their projects in real school classes.
- **Development of Multimedia Systems** (previously Multimedia Systems 2) \[SS 2021-2024\] - This seminar is part of the Master's program *Media Informatics and Digital Media Education* at the University College of Teacher Education Styria. It covers different topics related to multimedia systems, such as educational system design, game-based learning, evaluation, or web development.  \[[Course resources '23](https://xstone93.github.io/courses/MIM2_23.html)\]
- **Markup Languages** \[SS 2021-2022\] - This four-semester course is part of the Business Software Development program of FH Campus 02 (University of Applied Sciences). It covers the fundamentals of markup languages (HTML, XML, XSD, XPath) but also covers micro-services and interface design (REST, JSON).
- **Operating Systems**  \[WS 2020-2021\] - This first-semester course at the Business Data Science program of FH Campus 02 covers the basics of operating systems. The students worked on concepts such as process management, memory management, I/O devices, Bash programming, and computer architecture.

# Research 

## Reserach Vision
Motivated by [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/) I strongly favor the concept of having a reserach vision rather than a narrowly defined reserach area. My scientific "home base" lies at the intersection of  **technology** and **education**, which consititues the core of my research engeavors. Since **Data** affects my everyday life, my reserach vision turns around data:

> *Data is omnipresent, people generate it every day; it depicts our complex reality.
> Learning is ubiquitous; people learn every day; it is the basis for positive change.
> How can data and learning be linked to bring positive change?*

## Research projects

This (non-exhaustive) list of my latest (reserach) projects shows what I am interested in:

- [PM Stocket](https://pm-stocket.at/) - The PM Stocket is a tool that is used since 2021 in the course *Project Management* at Graz University of Technology. The tool was introduced to engage students into various activities within this class (but also beyond the scope of the course). The tool was evaluated every academic year and improved further to provide students with a motivating platform to learn and collaborate.
- [SMAwT](https://smawt.codislabgraz.org/) - The *Social Media Awareness Training* (SMAwT) is an interdisciplianry reserach project with teachers, educators, software developers, and reserachers from several areas. The aim of this tool is (and was) to train secondary school children in social media skills. The usage of the training was accompanied by a reserach study on how social media affects kids everyday life. 
- [sCool](https://scool.codislabgraz.org/) - The educational video game sCool was my entry point into academia and research. Based on the idea, that kids learn coding by working with a video game, the tool was developed furhter and improved in several Bachelor's and Master's thesis.

## Publications

I maintain my publications within a Google Docs [publication list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQNeT14SvJLDQMYDtfQeuHtdW_vwFraIA8bpwHQnCPM/edit?usp=sharing)

Before that, I liked to use [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Steinmaurer-3) for a while to manage all my publications. But as with almost every social network, it requires quite active maintenance, which takes some time. Even though RG has some good functionality to support you as much as possible, I ended up using mainly [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=vERJIRAAAAAJ) instead. There you can find all my (recent) papers.

## Working with me? 

If you are interested in my research area and would like to discuss your ideas for a Bachelor's or Master's thesis, I would love to hear from you - drop me an email (alexander.steinmaurer@it-u.at). Ensure that this email also contains some first serious thoughts on the topic, including an interesting problem/question you would like to answer (you do not have to come up with a solution/implementation, a good question is a perfect starting point!) 

# Useful Resources
- [Scientific Working](https://xstone93.github.io/sci-work/#/) - As part of my seminar/workshop on *Introduction to Scientific Working* at Graz University of Technology, I started a webpage with helpful guidance and resources. This page will be steadily growing and maintained.
